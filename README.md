## Install ##
The easiest way of doing this will be to make sure that `pip >= 9.0.1`. You can find the version number by running `pip -V`.
This makes installing the scientific computing packages a breeze. Just run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If for some reason that is not an option for you, then consider using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

## Starting up ##
Start up the jupyter server.
```
jupyter notebook
```
Then connect to it through your browser.
